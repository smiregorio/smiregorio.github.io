  <h1>Partfolio - Encyclopedia about Political parties in the EU</h1>
  <!-- Explanation-->
  <div>
    The 'Parfolio' dataset is designed for researchers and students who want to gain quick access to the information about 
    national and European political parties in the EU, given that the data are collected from reliable sources, 
    as well as anyone who is interested in European politics! The main idea is to create a publicly available collection of data that combines
    election results, party history, quantitative statistics of parties and party systems, and qualitative research of the party manifestos.
